## Installation / Run locally

1. Clone the repository (or download the project ZIP)

3. Open the project in your browser:

* Double-click `index.html`, **or**
* Serve it with a simple static server (recommended for extensions or CORS):

```bash
# using Python 3
python -m http.server 5500
# then open http://localhost:5500 in your browser
```

That's it — no build steps required.

## Typical Project Structure (update if your filenames differ)

```
rock-paper-scissor/
├─ index.html        # main HTML page
├─ css/
│  └─ styles.css     # stylesheet
├─ js/
│  └─ script.js      # game logic
└─ README.md
```

If your file names are different (e.g., `style.css`, `main.js`), adjust the structure above.

## How to Play

1. Open the app in a browser.
2. Click a move (Rock ✊, Paper ✋, or Scissors ✌️).
3. The computer will randomly choose its move.
4. Result (Win / Lose / Draw) and updated scores will be displayed.
5. Refresh the page to reset the game (or implement a reset button if desired).

---

## Customization ideas

* Add animations and sound effects for moves and results.
* Add a reset button to zero scores.
* Add best-of-N match mode and display match history.
* Make the UI theme configurable (dark/light mode).
